                We know that during COVID-19, a lot of folks around the city and
                state are feeling uneasy about the future - we’re not sure what
                the future holds either.
              </p>
              <p>
                That said: we know that we love making sure you have the gear
                you need for your adventures, and we’re going to keep doing that
                - with our team - until the city tells us we can’t.
              </p>
              <p>
                But as long as folks like yourself support small businesses
                around the city, then we’ll be here — every day, making sure
                your orders arrive on time.
